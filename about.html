		<h2>Why Pick Red Tail Rafting?</h2>
		<p>There are a lot of companies that operate on the same stretch of river as we do. We strive to set ourselves apart from the rest by offering our guests more than just a trip down the river.</p>
		<h3>Transportation!</h3>
		<p>For absolutely no extra cost, we provide transportation to the river from our Fraser location located a mile from dowtown Winter Park and transportation from Granby which is a short drive from Grand Lake. After a day of fun on the river, you can relax and enjoy a scenic ride back to town. Only Red Tail offers this service to their guests.</p>
		<h3>Food!</h3>
		<p>You will be burning a lot of calories paddling down the river, so we treat our half-day guests to a healthy snack. As a full-day guest, our guides will prepare a complete sideboard of fresh deli meats, cheeses, bread, fruits, and chips.</p>
		<h3>Time!</h3>
		<p>We like being on the river. There is no place we'd rather be, so we only run two trips a day. We offer one half day trip and one full day trip  per day. That allows us the time to make the trip right. We are not concerned with getting you off the river so we can get the next trip out. We like a relaxed pace that allows us to have more fun.</p>
		<h3>We Are a Family Owned and Operated Business!!</h3>
		<p>Every year we run a trip for our extended family and friends. It has become a yearly family outing. We run the same trip for our family as we do with our guests. We treat each guest like they are family. Safety is a priority! Whether we are rafting with our families, or your family in the boat, you can be sure that your safety is being fully accounted for.</p>
