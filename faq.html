		<h2>FAQ's</h2>
		<h3>1. Do you go rain or shine?</h3>
		<p>Yes! The beautiful thing about Colorado is that if you don't like the current weather, wait ten minutes. We get 300 days of sunshine a year, it is very rare to have a rain shower stick around for an entire day.</p>
		<h3>2. What do we wear?</h3>
		<p>Shorts and t-shirts. Quick drying apparel is best. Swimsuits work great. Wear shoes you don't mind getting wet. Water shoes are preferred, sandals(not flip flops) work well. Hats and sunglasses are no problem as well.</p>
		<h3>3. Is it cold? Do we need wetsuits?</h3>
		<p>Wetsuits are not needed! The majority of the days a wetsuit would be way too hot of an item to wear. Where we raft, it is on average 10 degrees warmer than in the Winter Park or Grand Lake areas. Keep in mind that you will be wearing a PFD(lifevest) that adds insulation to your core.</p>
		<h3>4. When do we need to book a trip by?</h3>
		<p>As soon as you know your the exact date you can go. We have limited availabilty and it it is not uncommon for us to book up a week in advance of our trips.</p>
		<h3>5. How many people on a boat?</h3>
		<p>Our rafts are capable of carrying 10 people plus a guide.</p>
		<h3>6. Do we tip our guide?</h3>
		<p>As with any service industry professionals, gratuity is greatly appreciated. Our guides strive very hard to make your trip safe and enjoyable for you and your whole family. If you enjoyed your ride, tip your guide!</p>
		<h3>7. What do we do with our valuables and keys?</h3>
		<p>We suggest you not bring valuables with you on our trips, its best to leave items behind in your vehicle. For car keys, you will ride to and from the river in the same vehicle, you can leave the keys as well as other items in the transport vehicle you arrived in.</p>
		<h3>8. What can we bring on the raft with us?</h3>
		<p>Not much! We do have small dry bags that can hold small items like cameras and sunscreen.</p>
		<h3>9. Are there restrooms available?</h3>
		<p>There are restrooms only at the put-in and take-out areas.</p>
		<h3>10. Is there water available?</h3>
		<p>Yes. We will have water available at the snack/lunch spot as well as water availble on the ride back from the river.</p>
