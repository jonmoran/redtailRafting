		<h4>What to wear</h4>
		<p>Apparel - Quick drying clothes work best, for most of our season, swim suits, t-shirts and shorts. For late may to early June, shorts and a t-shirt with a sweatshirt. We do provide you with a Splash Jacket if needed. It gets warm on the river. It typically runs 5 to 10 degrees warmer where we raft than in Winter Park.</p>
		<p>Footwear - Wear shoes that you don't mind getting wet. Water shoes and sandals such as Teva's or Keen's are perfect. Flip-flop's or thongs are not ideal. Not only do they not grip on wet rocks, they tend to come off and end up floating down the river.</p>
		<h4>Cameras -</h4>
		<p>We do have a dry bag on each raft were you can place a camera. You will have the opportunity to take photos at our stops. We have limited space available in the dry bags. Dry bags are not impact resistant, think twice about bringing you expensive SLR camera!</p>
		<h4>Professional Photography -</h4>
		<p>Most days that we operate, a camera person will be on the river at certain points taking pictures of each raft that goes by. Please check out <a href="www.muphotos.photoreflect.com">Mighty Upper Photos</a> to view pictures from your trip.</p>
		<h4>Drinks -</h4>
		<p>We will have water available at the snack or lunch stop. Feel free to bring a refreshment along for the ride to the river. You will not have time for drinking in the boat while we are rafting, so please leave the plastic water bottles behind in the transport vehicle</p>
